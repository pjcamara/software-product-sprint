            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>     Hi all, my name is Pablo Camara and I am a second year
                Computer Science and Mathematics student at the
                University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida. I was born
                in Ponce, Puerto Rico, but have been in Florida for the majority 
                of my life, and absolutely love the beach as a result of it.
                I'm currently really into practiced mindfulness through yoga
                and mediation, which has inspired me to meet as many new people
                as I can and brought much needed balance. In my free time I enjoy 
                hanging out with friends, running video and board games, watching
                anime, playing soccer, and learning cool math tricks.
                
            </p>

                        <h3>Trie Prediction - <i>Text Prediction in C Language</i></h3>
                        Developed a fully functional text prediction algorithm determined by
                        contextual co-occurence from a selected corpus using tries for
                        efficient lookup and insertion of strings; yielding a runtime of
                        O(k) where k is the length of an arbitrary string.

                        <h3>SimpleC Compiler - <i>Compiler for a simplified version of C
                            in C Language</i>
                        </h3>
                        Developed a compiler for a simplified version of C called 'SimpleC'.
                        The compiler currently supports arithmetic, branching, looping, 
                        parsing, and arrays.
